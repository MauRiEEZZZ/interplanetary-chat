Sniff around. What do you see? Spot anything mysterious..? Networking is all around us. People. Computers. Connections. Everything is just part of one big mesh. A world where radical ideas have to get through firewalls undetected can only be sustained by tools developed for that purpose. 

Interplanetary Chat is considered a secure chat for the likes of us.
